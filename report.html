		<h1 id='title'>Report a Street Issue</h1>	

		<p>The City of Westbrook Public Services provides a <a href='http://www.westbrookmaine.com/RequestTracker.aspx'>form</a> that you can use to report a street infrastructure issue and track its progress. This requires you to open an account, as instructed below. You may also directly contact the appropriate staff person by email or phone using the directory <a href='http://www.westbrookmaine.com/directory.aspx?did=12'>here</a>, or call the general Public Services number, 854-0660.</p>
		
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>The <a href='http://www.westbrookmaine.com/RequestTracker.aspx'>reporting page</a> allows you to report an issue in 6 different categories related to infrastructure, as well as report graffiti or a trash/recycling issue.</li>
			<li>You must create an account with the site in order to report an issue (see below).</li>
			<li>You can continue to track any of your own issues, either open or closed, as long as you are logged in.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Creating an Account</h2>
		
		<p>When you go to the <a href='http://www.westbrookmaine.com/RequestTracker.aspx'>reporting page</a>, look for the link on the right, above the category list, that says "<a href='https://me-westbrook.civicplus.com/MyAccount?dn=www.westbrookmaine.com&from=url&url=%2fRequestTracker.aspx%3fstrAction%3dLogin%26ysnSave%3d1%26newURL%3d&anchor=&validationMessage='>Login</a> to check existing requests". Once at the <a href='https://me-westbrook.civicplus.com/MyAccount?dn=www.westbrookmaine.com&from=url&url=%2fRequestTracker.aspx%3fstrAction%3dLogin%26ysnSave%3d1%26newURL%3d&anchor=&validationMessage='>login screen</a>, you have options to log in to an existing account with your email address, create a new account with your email address, or log in through Facebook or Yahoo. Creating an account is similar to other websites in that you enter an email address and desired password, and are sent an email asking you to validate your request. Once you have done that, your account is ready, and you should be returned to the Westbrook Public Services reporting page.</p>
		
		<h2>Reporting an Issue</h2>
		
		<p>Once you have created an account and are logged into it, clicking any of the 8 categories on the <a href='http://www.westbrookmaine.com/RequestTracker.aspx'>reporting page</a> will bring you to a form to enter the details: a brief description, the problem location (nearest street address), and your information. You can even optionally upload a photograph.</p>
		
		<h2>Tracking Your Issues</h2>
		
		<p>Use the "View Existing Requests" link to see your list of open and closed issues. At that screen, use the "Submit a new request" link to return to the screen with the categories to enter a new issue.</p>
		
		<h2>Account Settings</h2>
		
		<p>Use this link to set your address and phone number information. Whenever you report an issue, this information will be filled in automatically so you don't have to type it in again.</p>
		
		<hr style='margin: 30px 0;'>
		
		<p style='text-align: center; font-size: larger;'>Go to the <a href='http://www.westbrookmaine.com/RequestTracker.aspx'>reporting page</a> now!</p>
